- Depending on user's request either create a new one or update the existing lesson.
    - if you create a new lesson you MUST follow the same structure from existing files examples.
    - if you edit the lesson - you MUST follow user's instructions, like improvement, whatever
- When you create a new lesson it must be as consistent as provided examples. The whole point of
    the course is to be consistent in themes to improve the project with time to represent the example
- When building materials remember about time. The duration of the lesson is 3 hours.
