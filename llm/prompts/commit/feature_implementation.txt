  - and from `manage.py upsert_user_document`

## REASONING

- the system needs to populate users facts, based on the profile and insights information
- the system needs to populate users documents, based on the profile and facts about the user

## DETAILED

- `settings.py` has updated
- `manage.py upsert_user_facts`
  - provides `-u` parameter to specify user `UUID` to collect facts only about a single user
  - omit `-u` parameter to run the process for all the users in database
- `manage.py upsert_user_document`
  - provides `-u` parameter to specify user `UUID` to generate document only for a single user
  - omit `-u` parameter to run the process for all the users in database
  - only LLM is used to DETERMINE the FACTS about the user
  - after generation process information is embedded with default embedding model (`settings.EMBEDDING_MODEL`)
- `SetupEngineManager.upsert_user_document` celery task implements how the document is generated
  - generation process uses information from user's profile and generated facts
  - only LLM is used to DETERMINE the DOCUMENT's content
  - after generation process information is embedded with default embedding model (`settings.EMBEDDING_MODEL`)
- improved logger usage with `logging.getLogger`
- `ai.pipeline.prompts` now include templates for: _extracting facts from user profile_, _extracting facts from insights_ and _generating user document from facts_
  - input, output, prompt structures are added
  - Jinja2 templates are added
- `tests/matchmaker/test_manager.py::TestSetupEngineManager` updated
  - `test_upsert_user_facts` is added
  - `test_upsert_user_document` is added
  - mocks are added
- `identity/` includes only formatting changes
